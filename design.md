# Distributed C5.0 Algorithm Design for Vertically Partitioned Data

## Overview

This document outlines the design for a distributed implementation of the C5.0 algorithm for vertically partitioned data, based on the privacy-preserving approach described in the Vaidya and Clifton paper. The implementation will use the Weka library for ARFF file handling and Java sockets for communication between parties.

## System Architecture

The system will consist of the following components:

1. **Coordinator Node**: Manages the overall distributed computation process
2. **Data Party Nodes**: Hold different vertical partitions of the data
3. **Communication Layer**: Handles secure socket-based communication between nodes
4. **Privacy Protocol Layer**: Implements the privacy-preserving protocols
5. **ARFF Handling Layer**: Processes ARFF files using Weka
6. **C5.0 Core**: Implements the distributed C5.0 algorithm

## Component Details

### 1. Coordinator Node

The Coordinator Node is responsible for:
- Initializing the distributed computation
- Managing the communication between data parties
- Aggregating intermediate results
- Building the final decision tree
- Ensuring privacy preservation throughout the process

**Key Classes:**
- `CoordinatorNode`: Main class for the coordinator
- `DistributedC50`: Implements the distributed C5.0 algorithm
- `TreeBuilder`: Constructs the decision tree from secure computations

### 2. Data Party Nodes

Each Data Party Node:
- Holds a vertical partition of the data (subset of attributes)
- Processes local ARFF files
- Participates in secure computations
- Communicates only necessary information to preserve privacy

**Key Classes:**
- `DataPartyNode`: Main class for data parties
- `VerticalPartition`: Manages the vertical partition of data
- `LocalComputation`: Performs local computations on the partition

## Privacy-Preserving Protocol Details

Based on the Vaidya-Clifton paper, the implementation will use the following privacy-preserving techniques:

1. **Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC)**: For computing information gain and other metrics without revealing raw data
2. **Homomorphic Encryption**: To perform computations on encrypted data
3. **Secure Sum Protocol**: For aggregating counts without revealing individual values
4. **Oblivious Transfer**: For secure attribute selection
5. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: To verify computation correctness without revealing data

### Key Privacy-Preserving Algorithms

1. **Secure Information Gain Calculation**:
   - Each party computes local counts
   - Secure aggregation of counts using homomorphic encryption
   - Coordinator computes information gain from secure aggregates

2. **Secure Attribute Selection**:
   - Each party computes local gain for its attributes
   - Secure comparison protocol to find best attribute
   - Selected attribute is revealed without revealing its score

3. **Secure Tree Construction**:
   - Recursive secure computation of best splits
   - Secure distribution of instances to child nodes
   - Privacy-preserving pruning

## Data Flow

1. Each party loads its vertical partition from ARFF files
2. Coordinator initiates the distributed C5.0 algorithm
3. Parties engage in secure protocols to compute information gain
4. Best attribute is selected securely
5. Data is partitioned based on the selected attribute
6. Process repeats recursively until stopping criteria are met
7. Final decision tree is constructed at the coordinator

## Communication Protocol

The communication protocol will use Java sockets with the following message types:

1. **InitiationMessage**: Starts the computation process
2. **AttributeInfoMessage**: Shares metadata about attributes
3. **SecureComputationMessage**: Contains encrypted partial results
4. **TreeUpdateMessage**: Updates on tree construction progress
5. **CompletionMessage**: Signals completion of computation

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Privacy**: No raw data is shared between parties
2. **Computation Privacy**: Intermediate results are protected
3. **Result Privacy**: Only the final decision tree is revealed
4. **Communication Security**: All socket communications are encrypted
5. **Protocol Security**: Cryptographic protocols ensure computation security

## Implementation Plan

1. Implement the basic framework and communication layer
2. Implement ARFF handling with Weka integration
3. Implement the core distributed C5.0 algorithm
4. Implement privacy-preserving protocols
5. Integrate all components
6. Test with sample ARFF files
7. Optimize for performance and security

## Next Steps

1. Detailed class design for each component
2. Protocol specification for each secure computation
3. Integration plan with existing C5.0 implementation
4. Testing strategy for privacy and correctness
