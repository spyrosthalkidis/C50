# Distributed C5.0 Algorithm Implementation Todo List

## Requirements Gathering
- [x] Clarify use case and requirements with user
- [x] Confirm file format (.arff files like hypothyroid.arff)
- [x] Confirm communication method (Java sockets)
- [x] Confirm privacy requirements (privacy-preserving communication)
- [x] Confirm number of parties (general case)
- [x] Confirm performance considerations (no specific requirements)

## Repository and Library Review
- [x] Clone and examine the C5.0 repository structure
- [x] Review C5.0 algorithm implementation in the repository
- [x] Examine Weka library's ARFF file handling capabilities
- [x] Identify key components needed for vertical partitioning
- [x] Research Vaidya and Clifton's approach for privacy-preserving decision trees

## Design Phase
- [x] Design architecture for distributed C5.0 with vertical partitioning
- [x] Design privacy-preserving communication protocol
- [x] Design data structures for vertically partitioned data
- [x] Design interface between C5.0 and Weka components

## Implementation Phase
- [x] Implement server component for coordinating distributed computation
- [x] Implement client components for data parties
- [x] Implement privacy-preserving communication protocols
- [x] Implement vertical data partitioning handlers
- [x] Implement distributed C5.0 algorithm core functionality
- [x] Implement ARFF file parsing and handling

## Testing and Validation
- [x] Test with sample ARFF files
- [x] Validate privacy preservation
- [x] Test with multiple parties
- [x] Verify correctness against non-distributed implementation

## Documentation and Delivery
- [x] Document code with comprehensive comments
- [x] Create usage instructions
- [x] Prepare final code package for delivery
- [x] Deliver code to user with explanation
